# Starting content sharing<a name="starting-content-sharing"></a>

 You use content sharing features to share an entire screen, application, or browser tab\. You can trigger sharing with the *startContentShareFromScreenCapture* API\. This triggers the necessary browser\-specific screen sharing selector experience\. It also shares content into the meeting as a video stream\. 

```
this.meetingSession.screenShare.startContentShareFromScreenCapture();   
```
