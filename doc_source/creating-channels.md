# Creating channels<a name="creating-channels"></a>

You and your end users can create channels\. Once created, you or your end users also need to add members to the channel\. Sample code for creating channels is available in the [sample application](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/blob/master/demo/chat/src/api/ChimeAPI.js                  )\.
