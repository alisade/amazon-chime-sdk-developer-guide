# Web application architecture<a name="web-application"></a>

 A meetings web application may be served from a content delivery network and loaded when the user navigates to a URL in a browser\. It may also be wrapped in a platform\-native Electron application that users install on their machines\. The application makes REST requests to the server application to join a new or existing meeting\. Typically, this request should carry an authorization token or a cookie that your application uses for other API requests\. You can also design your web application to send a region hint to the server application, which the latter may use when providing the MediaRegion parameter to [chime:CreateMeeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html)\. Your web application can determine the closest Amazon Chime media services region by making an HTTP GET request to the [https://nearest\-media\-region\.l\.chime\.aws](https://nearest-media-region.l.chime.aws/) endpoint\.
