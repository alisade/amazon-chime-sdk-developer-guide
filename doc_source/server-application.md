# Server application architecture<a name="server-application"></a>

When a server application receives a request from a client, it first authenticates the user and ensures that the user is authorized to start a new meeting or join an existing meeting\. The server uses the embedded AWS SDK in the language of choice to make [chime:CreateMeeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html) and [chime:CreateAttendee](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAttendee.html) API calls to the global Amazon Chime media control plane to create the meeting, and the attendees, in one of the supported AWS regions\. To make these requests, the service needs the appropriate IAM user or role with the [AmazonChimeSDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html) policy\.
