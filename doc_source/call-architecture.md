# SIP application call architecture<a name="call-architecture"></a>

Amazon Chime SIP applications handle both one\-legged and two\-legged calls\. A *one\-legged call* can be outbound or inbound, but never both\. A *two\-legged* call occurs when you connect an inbound and an outbound leg, or two outbound legs\. For more details, see the following topics\.
