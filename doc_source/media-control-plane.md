# The meetings control plane<a name="media-control-plane"></a>

 The meetings control plane serves the [CreateMeeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html) and [CreateAttendee](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAttendee.html) APIs\. You use the APIs to create and manage meeting and attendee resources across the media plane\. In turn, the media plane validates credentials and ensures the session is bootstrapped in the media plane in the requested region\. Refer to [Available regions](sdk-available-regions.md) for information about the AWS regions that support meetings\. 

 The control plane also sends [ Amazon Chime SDK Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/ag/automating-chime-with-cloudwatch-events.html) to notification mechanisms such as Amazon EventBridge, Amazon Simple Queueing Service \(SQS\) or Amazon Simple Notification Service \(SNS\)\. The services are constantly monitored and designed to scale automatically as load increases\. By design, the APIs only accept opaque user identifiers and not user data, so they adhere to data sovereignty requirements\.
