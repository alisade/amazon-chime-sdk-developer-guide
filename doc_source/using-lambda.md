# Understanding SIP rules, SIP media applications, and Lambda functions<a name="using-lambda"></a>

 Amazon Chime administrators use the Amazon Chime console to create SIP rules and SIP media applications as part of building a telephony application\. A SIP rule associates a phone number in your Amazon Chime inventory, or an Amazon Chime Voice Connector, with a SIP media application\. A SIP media application associates your Lambda function with a SIP rule\. The Lambda function contains your phone application's logic, and it can perform that logic or return actions for each invocation\. For example, you can query or update a database, receive user input, or play voice prompts\.
